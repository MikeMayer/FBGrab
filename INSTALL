requirements to build:
you need these on your system:
libpng 
libz   
splint http://www.splint.org/

to build:
run 
make

to install 
run 
make install

Troubleshooting
If you don't realize how to install splint, remove that row from the Makefile.
You propably have the libs already installed but if not try to get the from your
distribution and secondly from:
zlib : http://www.gzip.org/zlib/ 
libpng : http://www.libpng.org/
