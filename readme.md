# FBGrab

This repo is a copy of [Gunnar Monell](mailto:gmo@linux.nu)'s FBGrab tool. I did not create this tool nor do I own it in any sense. I'm mirroring it in github for my own convenience as well as helping other people discover this useful tool.

FBGrab is a framebuffer screenshot program, capturing the linux frambuffer and converting it to a png-picture. FBGrab is delivered as is without any warranty and license is GPL version 2
